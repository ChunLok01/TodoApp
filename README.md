# TodoApp
 
The application is my final year project when I was pursuing Diploma in Web Development. It was developed for Android platform. It was developed to promote productivity, aid in task prioritization, effective task management and make use of time wisely. User can write down the pending tasks which need to be completed in future using the application. The application also provides other features such as calendar, timer, Pomodoro timer and more which enhance the productivity of users. 

Techniques/Languages: Flutter, Dart language

# Important Notes
The code files no longer exist due to an accidental mistake. Fortunately, we still have the APK file, which can be installed on an Android OS smartphone.
